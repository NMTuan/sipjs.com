Title: HackVOIP ?

VOIP isn't just for serious people trying start their own telephony service.  There are a lot of fun and creative ways that you can include voice, video, and text messaging in your application.

Here are just a few examples of the creative ways that I've seen people use VOIP to do cool things.

###[Activist.io](http://www.activist.io/)
This is a political activism application that was [originally used](http://grassroutes.us/sopa) to support a Stop SOPA campaign.  It is a browser widget, which detects a user's location, based on their ip address.  It then uses that location to determine who the user's senator is, and allows the user to call the senator's office right in the browser.  

###BananaPhone
A funny application that I actually worked on.  It is a prank calling application that calls your friend and plays the song Banana Phone.  The really fun part was that if you connected it to a [Makey Makey](http://www.makeymakey.com/), it could be controlled using an actual banana!

###TaftFacts
A play on words referencing the infamous [CatFacts](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/owx3v/so_my_little_cousin_posted_on_fb_that_he_was/) reddit prank.  This application texts you a fact of the day about the very interesting President William Taft.  Who wouldn't be interested in knowing that Taft was both the first president to own a car and the last to own a cow!

###CallMeMaybe
Songs are a great source of inspiration for creative projects.  This was a phone number that when you called, it would forward the call to the application creator's cell phone.  The gimmick was that it would only forward the call some of the time.
