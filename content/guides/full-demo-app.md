# Simple User Demo

We have created a demo that uses the Simple User interface in our [Github repository](https://github.com/onsip/SIP.js/tree/master/demo). You can clone the repository and follow the instructions to build and run the demo.

# Full API Demo

SIP.js maintains the `SimpleUser` interface which is a wrapper around our full API. We do not use anything outside of the API to create the `SimpleUser`. This allows you to reference the [code for `SimpleUser`](https://github.com/onsip/SIP.js/blob/master/src/platform/web/simple-user/simple-user.ts) as a reference point for the full SIP.js API.
