# Overview

SIP.js is a full-featured SIP stack written in TypeScript. With SIP.js, you can harness the power of WebRTC to build audio, video, and realtime data into your application. SIP.js is fast, lightweight, and easy to use.

SIP.js 0.15.x has introduced a new API (currently in beta), with new documentation autogenerated from our source. This documentation is now hosted [in our main repo](https://github.com/onsip/SIP.js/tree/master/docs).

To get up and running fast, check out our [getting started guides](/guides/).

SIP.js has TypeScript types available for most public facing interfaces. Types can be viewed on our [GitHub](https://github.com/onsip/SIP.js).
